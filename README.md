# ðŸ’³ Incur Debt CLI

Utility library to build calldata for Olympus Incur Debt partners.

### Installation

`npm install incur-debt-ts`
or
`yarn install incur-debt-ts`

### Use

In the interactions folder create a JSON file with the following information:

- Chain ID (Should always be 1 unless you are whitelisted for testing on Goerli)
- RPC Url (i.e. "https://goerli.infura.io/v3/00000000000000000000000000000000" but with your Infura or Alchemy key)
- Your multisig address
- The name of the DEX strategy you wish to use (i.e. "sushiswap")
- The address of the liquidity pool you wish to use on the DEX
- Your maximum allowed slippage level on deposit
- The amount of OHM you wish to borrow
  - NOTE: OHM uses 9 decimals so 10 OHM should be input as 10000000000
- If you are using Balancer as your DEX, an array of the other tokens you wish to deposit to the pool
- If you are using Balancer as your DEX, an array of the amounts of the previously specified other tokens you wish to deposit to the pool

An example for a OHM-DAI Sushiswap pool on Goerli can be found in `examples/goerli/goerliSushiParams.json`

To build the calldata for adding liquidity, run `npx incur-debt add-liq interactions/file.json` in the command line

### Current Status

Currently building transactions to add liquidity to Uniswap V2 and Sushiswap pools is supported and has been tested. The Incur Debt Curve and Balancer strategies have rudimentary implementations but Balancer requires you to enter the otherTokens and otherTokenAmounts in the order they appear in the Balancer Pool contract. Automated sorting will be coming in a future version, as will commands to build calldata for removing liquidity.
